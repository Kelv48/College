            <h2 id="russo-japan">The Russo Japanese War</h2>
            <p>
                On 8 February 1904 ships from the Imperial Japanese Navy (I.J.N) launched a surprise attack on The
                Russian
                Far East
                fleet anchored in Port Arthur, this leads to the beginning of the Russo – Japanese war <em>“interestingly
                    enough the
                    Japanese attacked before the official declaration of war was sent a strategy, they would also employ
                    for
                    the Pearl
                    Harbour attack against the Americans”.</em>

            <h2 id="squadron">The Reinforcements: Formation of the 2nd Pacific Squadron</h2>
            <p>
                With the First Pacific Squadron either inactive or scattered and Japan tightening its hold on Port
                Arthur,
                The Russians came up with a plan to send reinforcements either from the Black Sea Fleet or the Baltic
                Fleet.
                These ships would link up with the 1st Pacific Squadron and overwhelm the Japanese navy. With the
                situation
                deteriorating the Tsar agreed to the formation of the second pacific squadron. It would be placed under
                the
                command
                of <i lang="ru">Admiral Rozhestvensky</i> and would hopefully change the course of the war.
                The admiral, before they even set sail, said some of his subordinate senior officers were <b>"manure sacks"
                and "vast empty space". He also had to deal with rebellious captains and other senior officers.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although on paper sending reinforcements seemed like a good idea sending ships from the Baltic to the
                Pacific on a <b>10,000 mile</b>
                journey when the ships couldn't hold supplies for half that distance, not to mention the fact that
                Russia
                had no bases in Africa
                or South-East Asia to resupply at which would make the this voyage into the literal embodiment of the
                phrase
                <b>Voyage of the
                Dammed</b> a voyage which would literally <em>drive some of the men on it insane.</em>
