                <h2>Voyage Around Africa</h2>
                <p>
                    The fleet split apart after leaving Tangiers on 3 November 1904 due to worries that the draught of
                    the modern
                    battleships, which had proven to be significantly larger than intended, would prohibit their passage
                    through the Suez
                    Canal. Shortly after leaving the ships had "doubled" coal loads as at-sea re-coaling was such a
                    hassle, so coal was
                    stored everywhere on board and caused the ships' interiors coated with coal dust. <em>Many crew
                        members'
                        deaths were
                        caused by inhaling too much coal dust. Coal dust is also an explosive hazard.</em>

                    <i>Admiral von Fölkersahm</i> oversaw the older battleships and smaller cruisers as they navigated
                    the Suez
                    Canal, while
                    Admiral Rozhestvenski led the newer battleships and a few cruisers around the Cape of Good Hope. The
                    fleet
                    successfully completed this leg of the expedition before they were to meet up in Madagascar. The
                    lengthier
                    trip around Africa was difficult for the Russian crews under Rozhestvenski, who "had never
                    encountered such a strange
                    environment or such a lengthy time at sea," as "conditions on the ships worsened and a number of
                    sailors died of
                    sickness and respiratory problems." The Kamchatka ship was particularly afflicted and inept, and it
                    produced numerous
                    instances that afforded the other ships the impression of professionalism. <b>Due to the admiral's
                        propensity for
                        hurling binoculars overboard in a fit of rage, the admiral's crew had carried a stock of 50
                        binoculars.</b>

                <p>The third squadron was made up entirely of absolutely out-of-date ships, and Rozhestvenski refused to
                    maintain contact
                    with it since <em>they posed a greater threat to themselves than the Japanese.</em> To avoid working
                    with the
                    3rd squadron,
                    he even refused to divulge details of his routes. While cruising around Africa, the crew brought
                    unconventional
                    wildlife with them, including a crocodile and a deadly snake. The snake bit the officer in charge.
                    Additionally,
                    they gave Rozhestvenski a parrot, who rapidly adopted his extensive collection of vulgar Russian
                    phrases. During a gunnery practice, none of the ships hit the floating target, <b>one shell did hit
                        something
                        the ship towing the target.</b> Even more disorganized were the torpedo launch drills. <em>The
                        admiral instituted a
                        disciplinary program, ordering ships that broke formation to cruise alongside his flag ship
                        while he used his
                        megaphone to berate the captain in front of the entire crew.</em>

            The journey took half a year, was difficult to complete because the warships were unable to legally enter
            the ports
            of neutral countries, and the crews' morale suffered. To get to French Indochina (currently Vietnam), the
            Russians
            needed 500,000 short tons (450,000 t) of coal and 30 to 40 re-coaling sessions, and coal was supplied by 60
            colliers
            from the Hamburg-Amerika Line. The reunited fleet was anchored at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina by April
            and May
            of 1905.

                <h2>The Aurora</h2>
                <p>
                    The Aurora is in every conceivable way the exact opposite of the Kamchatka which in a squadron
                    surrounded by
                    ships that can't tell friend from foe is an inspiring sight. As one of the few ships in the squadron
                    that
                    performed with any sense of competency, the Aurora was frequently the target of friendly fire from
                    the less
                    capable ships. Aurora belonged to Admiral <i>Oskar Enkvist's</i> Cruiser Squadron, whose flagship
                    was the
                    cruiser Oleg,
                    a part of <i>Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvenski's</i> Baltic Fleet. The ship Aurora was traveling to the
                    Far East
                    when the
                    Dogger Bank incident occurred, which resulted in the deaths of the ship's chaplain and a sailor.
                    Aurora took
                    five strikes and sustained minor damage. On May 27 and 28, 1905, Aurora took part in the Battle of
                    Tsushima
                    alongside the rest of the Russian squadron. In the combat, 14 members of her crew, including Captain
                    Evgeny
                    Egoriev, lost their lives.
