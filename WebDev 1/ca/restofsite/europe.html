                    A destroyer collided with another battleship, and the flag ship lost its anchor before they even
                    setsail. A
                    Danish coal ship that had supplied them was rammed. Later
                    while sailing near Denmark an icebreakership was manoeuvring so poorly that the flag ship fired
                    several
                    rounds across its bows for disobeying orders to stop, and the
                    ship was sent home. These series of blunders didn't inspire Rozhestvenski with much confidence and
                    sets
                    the
                    theme for the rest of the voyage. There were rumours going
                    around that made many of the crew members believe that there was a Japanese torpedo-boat fleet, in
                    the
                    Baltic Sea, <b>about 18,000 miles away from Japan,</b> and were also
                    paranoid about Japanese mines. <em>"Another interesting fact they ignored is not only can torpedo
                        boats
                        not sail this extreme distance neither does Japan have enough to make
                        up what would constitute a fleet.”</em> A Russian message ship was mistaken for Japanese torpedo
                    boats
                    and fired upon at one point. The messenger informed Rozhestvenski that
                    he had been promoted to Vice-Admiral.

                    They later fired on British fishing vessels after mistaking them for torpedo boats and on each other
                    in
                    the
                    confusion. The Aurora, one of the Russian ships, was
                    hit by friendly fire; this despite the fact that it was frequently hit by friendly fire throughout
                    the
                    voyage and was known for being the most capable ship in the fleet
                    and, in a sense, the light in the darkness. Some of the ships claimed over the radio that they
                    thought
                    torpedoes were hitting them, and one ship claimed that they were
                    being boarded with its crew getting on life vests and getting ready to repel boarders with rapiers.
                    About
                    500 rounds were fired from one ship, but none of them hit the
                    target or a <em>target they simply didn’t hit anything.</em> When the admiral realized what was happening, he
                    gave
                    the order to stop firing, which was disregarded by everyone
                    else. They escaped the scene after realizing what they had done.

                <p>
                    28 cruisers and battleships were dispatched by the British to pursue the Russian squadron. A British
                    admiral
                    said he thought he only needed 4 battleships to engage the
                    entire Russian squadron and keep the rest of his ships in reserve in order to make the Russo-British
                    battle
                    "fair." <b>The only thing that prevented a war between Britain
                    and Russia was France's intervention.</b> France had a plan to form an anti-German block, and it didn't
                    work
                    out
                    well for them when their planned allies started killing each
                    other. Which resulted in a deal whereby Russia would surrender the officer responsible for the
                    dogger-bank
                    incident. Rozhestvenski took advantage of the situation to get
                    rid of an officer he didn't like.

                    After the diplomatic incident that almost triggered a war between the UK and Russia, one of the
                    ships
                    (the
                    Kamchatka) had fired on a Swedish, German and French ship after
                    mistaking those three for Japanese ships. Because of its poor gunnery, none of those ships were hit.
                    <em>With
                    its anchor, one of the other ships severed the underwater
                    telegraph cable connecting Tangier to Europe, cutting it off for five days.</em>

                <h3>The Kamchatka</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1903, the Kamchatka was commissioned into the Russian Baltic Fleet. Her main characteristics—a
                    sizable hold and sizable cranes—made her perfect for the job of repair ship.

                    The ship gained notoriety for its behaviour during the Second Pacific Squadron's voyage, which
                    helped cause the Dogger Bank incident. It was also involved in a great deal
                    of other incidents, such as mistaking neutral ships for Japanese torpedo boats and firing at the
                    Russian cruiser Aurora. Several ships in the fleet picked up a number of
                    local predatory animals while docking in Madagascar, and Kamchatka was no exception. When the ship
                    was sunk by Japanese shell fire in 1905 during the Battle of Tsushima, all
                    of the crew members perished.

                    The ship is also well-known in the media for its propensity to transmit the question <b>"Do you see
                    torpedo boats?" even when it was impossible for enemy torpedo boats to be
                    present, causing panic on board other ships in her squadron.</b>
