        <h2 id="Tsushima">Arrival at Tsushima</h2>
        <p>
            As they reached Japanese waters, the Russians sailed outside of typical shipping channels to lessen the
            likelihood of
            detection since they wanted to enter Vladivostok covertly. The Russian fleet neared the Tsushima Strait
            overnight on
            May 26, 1905. The Russians had the advantage that night because of the dense fog that covered the straits.
            On May 27,
            at 02:45 Japan Standard Time (JST), the Japanese auxiliary cruiser <i lang="ja">Shinano Maru</i> closed to investigate after
            spotting
            three lights on what seemed to be a vessel on the far horizon. <em>These lights were from the Russian hospital
            ship Orel,
            which had kept them burning in accordance with the laws of war.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i lang="ja">Shinano Maru</i> approached the ship at 04:30, seeing that she appeared to be an auxiliary and did not carry any
            guns.
            When they finally locate a Japanese ship, the Orel mistaken the <i lang="ja">Shinano Maru</i> for another Russian ship and
            made no
            attempt to alert the fleet. <b>This was after numerous false alarms during which they fired on merchants and
            friendly
            vessels alike. Instead, she flashed a signal to let the Japanese ship know that there were additional
            Russian ships</b>
            close by. The <i lang="ja">Shinano Maru</i> then noticed ten more Russian ships' silhouettes in the haze. Any hope of
            sneaking up on
            the Russian fleet and making it to Vladivostok had vanished.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the beginning, wireless telegraphy had a significant impact. The "Enemy is in square 203," Captain
            Narukawa of
            the Shinano Maru reported to <i lang="ja">Admiral Tōgō</i> in Masampo at 04:55. Radio transmissions that were intercepted at
            05:00
            notified the Russians that they had been found and that Japanese scouting ships were following them. At
            05:05,
            Admiral Tōgō received his telegram and started assembling his battle fleet for a sortie.

                <h2>The battle of Tsushima</h2>
                <p>
                    Admiral Tōgō wired a confident message to the naval minister in Tokyo at 06:34, saying that the
                    Combined Fleet would immediately start acting and make an effort to strike and destroy any enemy
                    ships that had been detected. Weather today fine but high waves. Former Japanese Prime Minister
                    Shinzo Abe has cited the last line of this telegram, which has gained notoriety in Japanese military
                    history. The whole Japanese fleet launched at the same time, with Tōgō leading almost 40 ships to
                    meet the Russians from his flagship, the Mikasa. The Japanese scouting ships that were chasing the
                    Russian fleet were sending wireless updates every few minutes about the formation and course of the
                    Russian navy.

                    The weather was bad, and there was mist that made it difficult to see. Admiral Tōgō highlighted the
                    following in his report on the battle: <b>"Wireless provided the Japanese an advantage."</b>
                    Although there was a thick fog over the water, making it hard to see anything more than five miles
                    away, [by wireless messaging] all the enemy's conditions were as plain to us, who were 30 or 40
                    miles away, as though they had been there in front of our eyes. Both fleets sighted one another at
                    13:40 and got ready to fight. Tōgō gave the command to raise the Z flag at 13:55 and made the
                    following announcement to the entire fleet:

                    The outcome of this war will determine the future of the Empire, therefore let each man perform to
                    the best of his ability. When Tōgō "crossed the Russian T" at 14:45, he was able to fire broadsides
                    while the Russians could only respond with their forward turrets.
                </p>
                <h2 id="day">Daytime Battle</h2>
                <p>
                    The Russians "continued to a point of junction where only their bow guns could bear, enabling him
                    [Tōgō] to throw most of the Russian batteries consecutively out of bearing" as they sailed from the
                    south-southwest to the north-northeast. Tōgō ordered the fleet to turn sequentially, allowing his
                    ships to follow the Russians' path while risking each battleship in turn. Despite Tōgō 's effective
                    U-turn, the flagship Mikasa was hit 15 times in five minutes by Russian gunnery that had proven to
                    be remarkably proficient. She was hit by large calibre shells 15 more times before the engagement
                    ended.

                    <strong>Rozhestvenski had only two choices: make "a straight charge, in line abreast," or begin "a formal
                    pitched battle." He chose the latter,</strong> and at 14:08, the Japanese flagship Mikasa was hit from a
                    distance of approximately 7,000 meters. At a distance of 6,400 meters, the Japanese responded. Then
                    superior Japanese gunnery struck, crippling the majority of Russian battleships.

                    On board the Knyaz Suvorov, Russian staff officer Commander Vladimir Semenoff stated, "It seemed
                    difficult even to count the number of projectiles impacting us." We felt as if shells were raining
                    down on us one after the other. Steel plates and superstructures on the upper decks were shattered,
                    and splinters caused several injuries. Iron ladders were crumpled into circles, and guns were
                    metaphorically thrown from their mountings. There was also the explosion's extremely high
                    temperature and liquid flame, which appeared to cover everything. "I saw a flash of fire begin on a
                    steel plate."

                    After 90 minutes of fighting, the Russian battleship Oslyabya of the 2nd Battleship Division was
                    sunk. <em>Gunfire had never brought a modern armoured vessel to its knees before.</em> The Japanese
                    battleship Fuji collided with the Russian battleship Borodino, causing her to explode and send smoke
                    thousands of meters into the air before sinking with all of her crew on board.

                    A piece of shell struck Rozhestvensky's head, knocking him out. In the evening, Russian Navy Rear
                    Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov took command. The Russians lost the battleships Knyaz Suvorov, Oslyabya,
                    Imperator Alexander III, and Borodino. <em>The Japanese ships were only slightly damaged.</em>
                </p>
                <h2 id="night">Night Engagement</h2>
                <p>
                    Around 2:00 in the morning, 21 destroyers and 45 Japanese torpedo boats attacked the Russians. While
                    the torpedo boats attacked from the Russian fleet's east and south, the destroyers launched their
                    attack from the front. There were several collisions between the small craft and Russian warships
                    during the night because the Japanese were aggressive and carried out their attacks for three hours
                    without stopping. The Russians were now scattered and making their way north in tiny groups. By
                    23:00, it seemed as though the Russians had vanished; nevertheless, by turning on their
                    searchlights—ironically, the searchlights had been switched on to spot the attackers—they gave their
                    locations to their pursuers.

                    The aging battleship Navarin ran into a chained floating mine that was set in front of her and was
                    forced to come to a stop so she wouldn't move the chain and invite additional floating mines on the
                    chain to encircle her. As a result, she was sunk after being torpedoed four times. Only three of the
                    crew of 622 survived; two were saved by a British merchant ship and one was saved by the Japanese.
                    The battleship Sissoi Veliky suffered significant stern damage from a torpedo and was scuttled the
                    next day. Admiral Nakhimov and Vladimir Monomakh, two aging armored cruisers, suffered severe bow
                    torpedo damage in the former and a collision with a Japanese destroyer in the latter.

                    The following morning, off Tsushima Island, where they had been heading while taking on water, they
                    were both scuttled by their crews. <b>The night attacks placed a great strain on the Russians, as they
                    lost two battleships and two armoured cruisers, while the Japanese lost only three torpedo boats.</b>

        <h2 id="surrender">Russian Surrender</h2>
        <p>
            The remnants of the Russian fleet were spotted heading northeast at 05:23 on May 28. Tōgō 's battleships
            then surrounded Nebogatov's remaining squadron south of Takeshima and began main battery fire at 12,000
            meters. The Russian cruiser Izumrud then attempted to flee to the south. Recognizing that his guns had been
            outraged by at least a thousand metres and that the Japanese battleships had proven to be faster than his
            own the day before, Nebogatov ordered the surrender of the six ships remaining under his command.
        </p>
        <p>  
            <b>The international surrender signal XGE was hoisted, but the Japanese navy continued to fire because they did
            not have "surrender" in their code books and had to quickly find one that did.</b> Still under heavy fire,
            Nebogatov ordered a white tablecloth to be sent up the masthead, but Tōgō, who had a Chinese warship escape
            him while flying that flag during the 1894 war, did not believe them.

            Furthermore, his lieutenants discovered the codebook that included the XGE signal and reported that stopping
            engines is required for the signal to mean "surrender," and all Russian ships were still moving, so he
            continued firing while the response flag signal "STOP" was hoisted. Nebogatov then ordered that the St.
            Andrew's Cross be lowered and the Japanese national flag be raised on the gaff, and that all engines be
            turned off. Tōgō declared a cease-fire and accepted <i>Nebogatov's</i> surrender after seeing the Japanese flag
            raised as the ensign. Nebogatov surrendered despite the fact that he could be shot for doing so. He told his
            men: <em>You are young, and you will one day restore the Russian Navy's honour and glory. The lives of the 2,400
            men on board these ships are more important than mine.</em>
        </p>
        <p>   
            Oryol was struck by five 12-inch, nine 8-inch, 39 six-inch, and 21 smaller or unidentified rounds, as an
            illustration of the extent of damage caused on a Russian battleship. After Tōgō accepted the surrender, the
            Japanese navy escorted her to the home port of the First Battle Division, Sasebo in Nagasaki, where she
            listed and the engine failed. The battleship Asahi was obliged to tow the battleship Oryol, and their route
            was shifted to the adjacent Maizuru Naval Arsenal, in order to prevent losing the prize of war.

            Admiral Rozhestvensky went to the Imperial Japanese Naval Hospital in Sasebo to recover from a
            shrapnel-injured head injury; there, the victorious Admiral Tōgō personally visited him in plain clothes,
            comforting him with kind words: "A soldier's fate is often defeat. It contains nothing to be ashamed of. The
            important question is whether we have done our job ".
        </p>   
        <p>
            When Nebogatov and Rozhestvensky returned to Russia, they were put on trial. <em>Rozhestvensky claimed full
            responsibility for the disaster and was sentenced to death, but the Tsar commuted his sentence because he
            had been wounded and unconscious during the final stages of the battle.</em> After surrendering the fleet,
            Nebogatov was imprisoned for several years before being pardoned by the Tsar.

            Until the evening of May 28, isolated Russian ships were pursued by the Japanese, who destroyed or captured
            nearly all of them. Three Russian warships have arrived in Vladivostok. Despite being present at Nebogatov's
            surrender, the cruiser Izumrud escaped the Japanese and was destroyed by her crew after running aground on
            the Siberian coast.
