            This page is being done as a html project and for lack of any thing else of actual substance to place on it I've decided to place my 
            History Rsr project from my leaving cert on here in order to test the website and ensure that it works.

            History RSR: The Battle of Midway
        </h2>
        <p>
            Turning point for the Pacific War? 
        The Battle of Midway was an epic clash between the U.S Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy (I.J.N) that played out six months after the surprise attack on pearl 
        harbor and America’s entry to the war and was the largest battle between Japan and America up to this point. Midway was not only a defensive operation for the 
        American’s it was a chance for revenge, 4 of the 6 carriers who were present at pearl were now at Midway and America wanted them sunk. The U.S Navy’s Tactical and 
        Strategic Victory at The Battle of Midway is credited by many historians as a turning point for the war “The annals of war at sea present no more intense, heart-shaking 
        shock than this battle”-Sir Winston Churchill. In my research project this essay will analyze the battle to discern if it truly was a turning point in the war or if it was 
        merely the first in a series of knockout blows that finally take the I.J.N out of action.
