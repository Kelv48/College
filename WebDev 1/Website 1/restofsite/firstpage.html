            It is said that history does not happen in a vacuum; with this in mind, most accounts of the Battle of Midway (June 4-7, 1942) only briefly mention The Battle of 
            The Coral Sea (May 4-8 1942). The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first naval battle in which the opposing fleets never spotted or fired directly on each other; 
            all combat was conducted via aircraft. Although the battle was a tactical defeat for the Americans due to heavy damage to the USS Yorktown (CV-5) and the outright 
            destruction of the USS Lexington (CV-2), it was viewed as a strategic victory because the Americans achieved their goal of maintaining communication lines with Australia.
             The Japanese left the battle high on their tactical victory and also reported the sinking of two American carriers; this belief that America only had two remaining 
             carriers in the Pacific is what drew Japan into the Battle of Midway.

            Vice Admiral Chichi Nagumo commanded the Kido Butai, which was accompanied by four carriers during the battle. Akagi had 54 planes on board, Kaga had 63, Hiryu had 54,
             and Soryu had 52. The Japanese used ASM Zero fighters nicknamed the Zero because of their high manoeuvrability, Aichi D3A dive bombers nicknamed Vals by the allies, 
             and finally Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers nicknamed Kates. Despite commanding the world's most capable carrier force, his task would be difficult because he essentially 
             had a dual mission. He had to take out Midway Island and keep an eye out for any American carriers that might show up, which wasn't expected for a few days. The Japanese
              did, however, set up a submarine screen to notify them of the arrival of the US carriers. Unfortunately for the Japanese, by the time the screen was in place, 
              taskforces 16 and 17 had already passed and were making their way to Midway.

            The US forces consisted of three aircraft carriers divided into two task forces: Task Force 16 was led by Raymand Spruance and included the carriers Enterprise (CV-6) 
            and Hornet (CV-8), while Task Force 17 was led by Admiral Fletcher and included the Yorktown. The Americans had 234 aircraft spread across three carriers, with an 
            additional 127 on Midway. The US carrier planes were made up of Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, which were bulkier but more armoured than the Zeros, the Douglas TBD 
            Devastator torpedo bomber, which was obsolete before the war began, and the Douglas SBD Dauntless scout bomber, which was the workhorse of US carrier aviation.
