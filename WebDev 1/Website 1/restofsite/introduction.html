            The Battle of Midway – Turning point in The Pacific 
            “December 7 1941 a day which will live in infamy” the day Roosevelt gave this speech to congress was the day Americans learned they can no longer sit on the 
            side-lines the world was once again in conflict and now not even they were safe. 
            Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbour was only the beginning in quick succession it rapidly and violently expanded across Asia and The Pacific it’s 
            empire would soon span more than a fifth of the worlds surface and there seemed to be little in slowing it down. The Battle of Midway takes place 6 months after America’s
             entry into the war when they were at a disadvantage facing a fanatical and battle-hardened enemy who outnumbered them in aircraft carriers and experienced pilots. 
            However even Japan knew this dominance wouldn’t last forever America was frantically building new carriers for it’s fleets but that would take time until then it was 
            vulnerable. So Japan hoped to lure America’s few precious carriers into a trap by launching an all out assault on the island of Midway the battle that followed would be
             one of the most crucial moments of the war. This essay will analyse the lead up to and the battle itself and to see if Midway was the turning point in the Pacific it’s 
             claimed to be.

            The Battle of Midway is considered one of the most decisive naval battles in human history, alongside the Battles of Jutland and Trafalgar. 
            The Battle of Midway was dubbed "the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare" by military historian John Keegan. Many historians 
            regard the US Navy's tactical and strategic victory in the Combat of Midway as a watershed moment in the war. "The annals of war at sea present no more dramatic, 
            heart-shaking shock than this battle," wrote Sir Winston Churchill. This essay will analyse the battle as part of my research project to determine whether it truly 
            was a turning point in the war or if it was simply the first in a series of knockout blows that eventually put the I.J.N (Imperial Japanese Navy) out of commission.
